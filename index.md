# Laurence Wilse-Samson

I am an economist and researcher based in New York City, working as a consultant and serving as adjunct faculty at Columbia University and NYU. My work spans applied research, policy analysis, and teaching, with a focus on understanding how economic institutions shape development and how governments can use economic tools more effectively.

My interests are broad including public finance, geoeconomics, economic history, and policy.
